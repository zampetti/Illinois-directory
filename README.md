# Directory Design Project
An opportunity to demonstrate database, backend coding, Javascript, CSS, and HTML coding.

## Sample Data
Sample user profile data can be found in the "/data" folder

* [user-profiles-5.json](data/user-profiles-5.json) has 5 entries.
* [user-profiles-500.json](data/user-profiles-500.json)  has 500 entries.

## Design Documentation
The PDF [directory-wireframe.pdf](design%20documents/directory-wireframe.pdf) depicts desired layouts on desktop and a mobile devices.

The PDF is meant to be a back-of-the-napkin type design document.  We'd like to replicate it conceptually, but it doesn't need to be exact. 

* **Page 1**:
Logical data elements.  A person belongs to 0 or 1 department.

* **Page 2**: Desktop layout, 1 entry per row.

* **Page 3**: Desktop layout, card design.  
Cards flow left to right, top to bottom.

* **Page 4**: Mobile layout, 1 entry per row.

## Desired Features

* Entering text in the search box will filter a users for matches in any of the displayed properties (name, email, title, department, description)

* On desktop device a user can choose the card or full row layout.

* A mobile device (width <= 480px wide) will show the mobile layout.

* A user can chose to sort by name or by department.

## Goal

By going through this exercise we'd like to see:

1. How you approach a programing project.
1. How you might design a backend data storage and data access.
1. How you use Javascript, CSS, and HTML to accomplish the UX design goals.

This a chance to demonstrate your preferred build environment and tools (e.g. TypeScript, SCSS, Webpack, Gulp, Bootstrap, React, Angular).  Or you may prefer to use vanilla JS and CSS.

We're not really looking for a whiz-bang flashy solution.  We'd like a well thought out one where you can discuss your design and programming process and choices.
